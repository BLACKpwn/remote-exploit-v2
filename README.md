# Remote Code Execution Vulnerability Mitigation Project

This project aims to address and mitigate Remote Code Execution vulnerabilities in web applications.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage
1. Run the `app.py` script.
2. Send POST requests to `http://localhost:5000/execute` with a 'command' parameter to execute commands securely.

## Security Considerations
- Input validation is implemented to prevent command injection.
- Regular security audits and testing are recommended to ensure the effectiveness of the mitigation.
